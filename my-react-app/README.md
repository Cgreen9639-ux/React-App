# My React App

This project is a full-stack application that consists of a React frontend and an Express backend. The server serves the static files from the React app, allowing for seamless integration between the client and server.

## Project Structure

```

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-react-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies for both the server and client:
   ```
   npm install
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the React app:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start the server:
   ```
   cd ..
   node server/index.js
   ```

The server will now serve the React application, and you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Scripts

- `npm start`: Starts the server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the React app for production.
